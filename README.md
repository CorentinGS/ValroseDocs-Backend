# ValroseDocs
A website to share my personal notes from College to other students. 

This Flask app used the Mathcha "private" API to fetch the documents and redirect the user to an embedded version of the document.
The snapshot come from [Mathcha.io](https://mathcha.io/) website which is a great tool for writing maths documents from a computer.
